# DeepFake GUI  
A streamlined, GUI-Flask powered application for detecting deepfakes using **ResNeXt50 + LSTM** architecture.

ðŸš€ **Detection Goal**:  
Classify videos/images into:  
- `real` (labeled as `0`)  
- `fake` (labeled as `1`)  

---

## ðŸ›  Features  
- **Deep Learning Model**: Custom architecture combining ResNeXt50 and LSTM for high-accuracy deepfake detection.  
- **GUI Interface**: No command-line hassleâ€”upload files and view results directly via an intuitive user interface.  
- **Input**: Supports video inputs.
